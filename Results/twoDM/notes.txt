Things to Notice:

Many plots have lines that are pretty much on top of each other.

For Coannihilation:
-Coannihilation does indeed change the values for Y (m_DM = 150), its just very small
-In Co1, the reason the red goes under the equilibrium value has to do with how Y1*Y2-Y1eq*Y2eq behaves
 since the radiation essentially cancels.
-In Co4, all the lines are on top of each other, as expected.
-In Co5, all the lines are decreasing.

For annihilation DM2 + DM2 -> DM1 + DM1
-Keep in mind that there is an assumption in the formula that the matrix element for the reverse process
 is the same.
-Again, the 150 does change, just not noticibly.
-In Ann4, we expect the freezeout to be independent of this coupling, and we indeed get that.
-We expect Ann5 and Ann6 to be exactly identical except with the blue and red reversed, and this is what we see.
 In this plot, both lines are coming closer to each other in both cases.
